      <description>Abstract TODO: Define AI
Branches of AI:
Computer Vision Image classification — classifying images based on their contents Object detection — classify individual objects with an image and identify their location in the image Semantic segmentation — individual pixels are classified according to the object to which they belong; used to create overlays and highlights in an image Image analysis — extracting information (&amp;ldquo;tags&amp;rdquo;) from images to catalog the image or create descriptive captions Face detection, analysis, and recognition — a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces Optical character recognition — detects and reads text in images Document Intelligence — managing, processing, and using high volumes of a variety of unstructured data in forms and documents.</description>

      <description>Abstract [Documentation] Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Responsible AI standard defines a responsible AI system as ethical (inclusive and accountable) and explainable (fair, transparent, reliable, safe, private and secure).
The Six Responsible AI Principles:
Fairness How might an AI system allocate opportunities, resources, or information in ways that are fair to the humans who use it?
An AI system&amp;rsquo;s decisions must not discriminate against, or express a bias toward, a group or individual based on gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion.</description>

      <description>Overview Prompt engineering is a field of study of the design and optimization of prompts to deliver consistent and quality completions for a given model.
Motivation LLMs have a variety of shortcomings to produce reliable and consistent completions:
The model responses are stochastic (the same prompt may produce different responses). The model can fabricate (previously: hallucinate) responses. The model capabilities vary. Prompt Construction Basic prompt Prompt
