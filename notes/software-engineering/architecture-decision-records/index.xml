      <description>Issue Describe the architectural design issue you’re addressing, leaving no questions about why you’re addressing this issue now. Following a minimalist approach, address and document only the issues that need addressing at various points in the life cycle.
Decision Clearly state the architecture’s direction—that is, the position you’ve selected.
Status The decision’s status, such as pending, decided, or approved.
Group You can use a simple grouping—such as integration, presentation, data, and so on—to help organize the set of decisions.</description>
