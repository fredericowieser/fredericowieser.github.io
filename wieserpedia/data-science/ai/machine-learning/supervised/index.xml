      <description>Abstract In supervised machine learning, training data includes both feature values and label values. Models are trained by finding a relationship between the features and labels in past observations so that unknown labels can be predicted in future cases.
Supervised machine learning approaches are categorized as follows:
Regression Binary classification Multi-class classification </description>

      <description>Abstract [Reference] In binary classification supervised machine learning, the label represents a class that describes whether the observed item is or is not an instance of a specific class.
Predict one of two mutually exclusive outcomes. Example: whether a patient is at risk for diabetes based on weight, age, blood glucose level, etc. Training Binary Classification Models Use an algorithm to fit the training data to a function that calculates the probability of the class label being $true$.</description>

      <description>Abstract [Reference] In multi-class classification supervised machine learning, the label represents one of multiple possible classes.
Usually, the labels are mutually exclusive. In multi-label classification models, there may be more than one valid label for an observation. Follows the same train &amp;gt; iterate &amp;gt; evaluate process as regression and binary classification. Examples: The specifies of penguin based on its physical measurements. The genre of a movie based on its cast, director and budget.</description>

      <description>Abstract [Reference] In regression-based supervised machine learning, the label predicted by the model is a numeric value.
Training Regression Models Split the data (randomly) to create a training dataset and a validation dataset. Use a regression algorithm (perhaps linear regression) to fit the training data to a model. Use the validation dataset to test the model by predicting labels for the features. Evaluate the model&amp;rsquo;s performance by comparing the known actual labels in the validation dataset to the labels that the model predicted.</description>
