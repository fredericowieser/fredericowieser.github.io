      <description>Abstract In unsupervised machine learning, models are trained using data that consists only of feature values without any known labels. The models determine relationships between the features of the observations in the training data.
Clustering [Reference] Identifies similarities between observations based on their features and groups them into discrete clusters. The label is the cluster to which the observation is assigned based only on its features. Examples: Flowers based on their size, number of leaves, and number of petals.</description>
