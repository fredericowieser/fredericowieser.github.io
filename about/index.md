# About

I am currently finishing my **MSc in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL**. Prior to this, I obtained a BSc in Theoretical Physics at UCL, during which I started to get more interested in Computers than Physics 🤦. After my BSc, I worked for 3 years doing professional software engineering.

I am currently completing my Master's thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/Jun.Wang/index.html) and [Dr. Zafeirios Fountas](https://zfountas.com) as part of being a Research Intern at [Huawei's Reinforcement Learning Lab (Noah's Ark)](https://noahlab.com.hk/#/home).

Outside of work, I also enjoy coding, F1, board games, and art. If you're interested in connecting contact me below. I am always open to discussing new projects, ideas, or collaborations.
