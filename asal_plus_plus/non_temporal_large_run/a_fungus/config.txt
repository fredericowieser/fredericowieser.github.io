evolve_instruction: This artificial life simulation has been optimised to produce PREVIOUS TARGET PROMPT: '{current_prompt}'.
Consider this as a constraint: an ecological niche that have already been explored.

Your task is to propose the NEXT TARGET PROMPT to determine the next stage of evolution.  This is an opportunity to propose a direction that is significantly different from the past, but leads to interesting lifelike behaviour.  Can we recreate open-ended evolution of life?  Be bold and creative!  ONLY output the new target prompt string, and be concise. Avoid using too many adjectives.
