what an intense experience it turned out to be! The event brought together some of the most passionate developers and innovators I’ve seen in quite a while, with participants flying in from as far as Switzerland and the USA. The stakes were high, with substantial prizes on the line, and you could feel the energy in the room.

Our vision was to create an Electron-based application that would improve doctor-patient interactions. The core idea was elegant in its simplicity: create a system that would listen to doctor-patient conversations in real-time, transcribe them, and automatically generate comprehensive medical notes. But we didn’t stop there. We also wanted to implement an intelligent question suggestion system that would dynamically update based on the conversation flow, ensuring doctors wouldn’t miss any crucial points during their consultations. Looking back, I can see how this could be valuable beyond just medical consultations - any professional conversation could benefit from such a system.

The challenge wasn’t just in implementing these technologies individually, but in making them work together seamlessly in real-time. One of our biggest learning moments came from our approach to integration. We spent too much time developing the frontend and backend independently, leaving the crucial integration phase until around midnight. In retrospect, this was our first major lesson: start with integration. It’s better to have a fully connected system early, even if it’s basic, than to have two sophisticated but separate pieces that you’re trying to join at the last minute. The real technical challenge emerged around 4 AM (yes, we pulled an all-nighter!) when we were wrestling with the efficient decoding of live-streamed audio data while trying to perform inference on various models. Sadly getting this to work in a timely manner while maintaining accuracy was no small feat, and we missed the mark on delivering the full working prototype.

While we managed to push through until 9 AM, I’ve made a mental note for future hackathons: no code written after 2 AM is worth the sacrifice of clear thinking the next day. Though I must admit, there’s something special about those late-night coding sessions, even if they’re not the most productive.

When using you do not have to be familiar with Go and it is even possible to only have to write Markdown files when making your own website. When I have used it though I have found it very useful to know some HTML/CSS and Javascript, these tools allow you to customise your website much more and have helped me to tailor the websites I’ve made in the past to have great features such as tools to pull information from other sites to then be displayed or even to implement your own commenting system. The use cases are pretty wide. I myself have made Hugo powered websites for the technical documentation of a few teams at one of my previous roles and have also now used it to write the website you are most likely reading this on at https://fredericowieser.github.io/.
