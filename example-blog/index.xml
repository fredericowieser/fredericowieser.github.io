      <description>abstract First impressions of the iPhone 14 Pro from a long-time Google Android user (since the Nexus One!)
[✔] likes ✔ Display responsiveness. It&amp;rsquo;s faster than my most recent Android phone, a Google Pixel 6. At times, when typing fast, my Pixel would &amp;ldquo;miss&amp;rdquo; touches—this phone doesn&amp;rsquo;t.
✔ Display brightness. I can see the screen in sunlight while wearing sunglasses. I used to have to peer over my sunglasses to see my Pixel&amp;rsquo;s display in the sun.</description>

      <title>on the state of software in 2023</title>

      <description>In 2023, the majority of software on planet Earth is poorly constructed. This is true for everything from small mobile apps to mid-sized line of business applications to large distributed enterprise systems. It is true for application software, firmware, operating systems, embedded systems, and IoT systems. Low quality software exists in both open- and closed-source codebases. The software we use in our personal and professional lives every day is unreliable.</description>

      <description>overview I recently ran into compiler warning cs0436 while working on a solution with a shared project in VS2022. If you run into the same, this might help you troubleshoot.
scenario You&amp;rsquo;re working on a solution that contains a project, alpha (which is also the name of its namspace). That project contains a project reference to another project, bravo:
alpha |--bravo Shared project, charlie, contains code that is used by alpha, bravo, and other projects.</description>

      <title>on best practices</title>

      <description>Something that has always puzzled me about some organizations is their tendency to ignore best practices.
One particular industry has ignored best practices for decades, filling the gap with hastily developed, poorly vetted practices instead.
This tendency�phenomenon, even�holds true for organizations of various size, specialization, and maturity in this anonymous industry. It is pervasive and deep-rooted.
What is a best practice? Many definitions exist. Here is Merriam-Webster&amp;rsquo;s:
&amp;ldquo;a procedure that has been shown by research and experience to produce optimal results and that is established or proposed as a standard suitable for widespread adoption.</description>

      <description>For as long as I can remember, people have told me that I do not speak enough. The feedback has come from family, friends, and colleagues throughout my life. I regularly respond to questions such as �you didn�t say much in that meeting�is everything okay?� and �you sure don�t have much to say, do you?� to comments such as �you seem quiet today.� I�m an introvert, of course, so these comments are peculiar sometimes.</description>

      <title>on delegation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/example-blog/on-delegation/</link>

      <description>There may be many things you struggle with as a leader. Do not let delegation be one of them. Think of delegation not as something that you can do as a leader, but instead as something that you must do.
By delegating tasks, you are providing your team with an opportunity to deliver results (in their own way) and, hopefully, to learn new skills or sharpen existing ones. Consider that by not delegating a task, you are actively preventing the growth and development of your team.</description>
