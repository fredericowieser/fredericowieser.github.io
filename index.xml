      <description>What is Asynchronous Programming? &amp;ldquo;Asynchrony, in computer programming, refers to the occurrence of events independent of the main program flow and ways to deal with such events.
These may be &amp;ldquo;outside&amp;rdquo; events such as the arrival of signals, or actions instigated by a program that take place concurrently with program execution, without the program blocking to wait for results.&amp;rdquo; - Wikipedia
One can also think that in a way asynchronous programming is analogous to the programmer giving up control of execution to the computer.</description>

      <title>#1 Making A Hugo Website</title>

      <description>What is a Hugo Website Hugo is a static site generator for creating fast and fairly complex websites, written in Go. When using you do not have to be familiar with Go and it is even possible to only have to write Markdown files when making your own website. When I have used it though I have found it very useful to know some HTML/CSS and Javascript, these tools allow you to customise your website much more and have helped me to tailor the websites I&amp;rsquo;ve made in the past to have great features such as tools to pull information from other sites to then be displayed or even to implement your own commenting system.</description>
